Factory Design pattern: 
(Creational design pattern)
Need to create object on the basis of some condition (condition 1 -> obj1, condition 2 -> obj2)

Provides a class for creating objects allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created.
It encapsulates object creation logic in a seperate method promoting loose coupling.


A class has a parameterized constructor.
Now u use that class as a service class and autowire it in other service classes.
So how will the parameterised constructor of that class be invoked.
